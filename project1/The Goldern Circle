<p><i> The Golden Circle</i> in Iceland is a must-visit tourist route, renowned for its striking natural wonders and historical significance. This circular journey typically includes three primary attractions: Thingvellir National Park, where Iceland's ancient parliament once convened amidst a dramatic tectonic rift; the Geysir Geothermal Area, home to the erupting Strokkur geyser and bubbling hot springs; and Gullfoss, a majestic two-tiered waterfall often adorned with rainbows. These awe-inspiring landmarks, easily accessible from Reykjavik, showcase Iceland's geological marvels and cultural heritage, making the Golden Circle an essential part of any Icelandic adventure.</p>
